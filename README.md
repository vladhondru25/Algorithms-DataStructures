# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo contains algorithms and data structures implemented in Python after following the online course offered on Coursera by Princeton University [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome). Although the course was taught in Java, my implementations should be very similar. Furthermore, there are some interview coding problems included as well.
